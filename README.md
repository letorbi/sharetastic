# Sharetastic - super simple file-transfer

Sharetastic aims to be the most simple solution for sharing files. It consists of a web-service written in Go and JavaScript with no further dependencies, so that it can be easily installed on your own server. Sharetastic is licensed as open-source under the AGPL version 3.

*Sharetastic is still an alpha! Its core functionality is working, but there are still some parts missing. Apart from that there could still be undiscovered bugs and breaking interface changes are likely to happen, so it is not recommended to use it in production projects, yet.*
